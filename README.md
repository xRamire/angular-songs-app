## Intro

AngularSongsApp is a web application built with Angular that allows users to manage a list of songs. It provides the following features:

- **View Songs:** Users can view a list of songs retrieved from a server.
- **Song Details:** Users can click on a song to view its details, including title, artist, album, genre, and poster.
- **Add New Songs:** Users can add new songs to the database by providing the title, artist, album, genre, poster, and other details.

The application utilizes Angular's routing and HttpClient modules to interact with the server-side API for fetching and storing song data.
